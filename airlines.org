Project:


Data Used:
This project uses two main data sets, the first is a set of reviews for
airline carriers pulled from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juhibhojani/airline-reviews/data and saved
in the file named 'Airline_review.csv'. The
second is a record of airline incidents and accidents pulled from the NTSB:
https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/Pages/research.aspx and saved in a file named
'AviationAccidentStatistics_2003-2022_20231228.xlsx'. Since the data from the
NTSB doesn't directly mention the air carrier involved with each incident
but the registration number, I had to run each registration number through
the FAA website at:
https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/Search/NNumberInquiry. Since there
are hundreds of records to work with, I wrote up a script to run the
numbers through this site automatically and then wrote the results to a new
file that I named 'registration_info.txt'.
